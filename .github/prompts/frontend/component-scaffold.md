# Scaffold a reusable MUI v7 component with tests

Use `.github/frontend.instructions.md`.

Task:

- Create a reusable MUI component.
- Props: `variant`, `size`, `loading`, `aria-label` (as relevant), and event handlers.
- Requirements: keyboard accessible; SSR-safe; forwardRef where it makes sense.

Deliver:

1) Component in the target path.
2) Minimal usage snippet in an existing page.
3) Test skeleton (render + keyboard interaction).
