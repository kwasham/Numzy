Generic single-database configuration.

Project Note (2025-08-28):
This codebase previously had TWO migration roots:
	1. legacy: backend/alembic/versions
	2. active: backend/migrations/versions (configured via alembic.ini script_location)

The legacy path accumulated a few revisions (add_background_jobs, add_subscription_state_fields, etc.)
while new work landed in migrations/versions, creating divergent histories and multi-head issues.

We are standardizing on migrations/versions ONLY.
Action items:
	- Do not add new revisions under backend/alembic/versions.
	- After all environments are stamped at head, we will archive the legacy directory or remove it.
	- A helper script widened alembic_version.version_num to 255 to accommodate longer revision ids.

If you encounter multiple heads again, run:
	docker compose run --rm api alembic heads
and inspect for any stray revisions reintroduced under the legacy path.
