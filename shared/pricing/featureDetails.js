// Detailed descriptions for features exposed in the pricing catalog.
// These descriptions can be used by the frontend (e.g. tooltips in the
// pricing cards) or by documentation to explain what each feature
// provides.  Only a subset of features (including those relevant to
// the Personal plan) are documented here; new entries can be added as
// plans evolve.
